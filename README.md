# BounceAround
### Take a minute to bounce and spin around! Play here
## This is a simple game I built with JavasScript and the HTML5 Canvas
## This game required a bit of extra precision to handle the almost instantaneous interaction between the player and the trampoline. Thus, data on both of their positions/velocity needed to be stored in each frame for instant access.

## I used the keymaster (https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster) library to handle the player activity
